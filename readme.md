Origami originally started as an attempt to make an SMTP server for development that could
handle TLS (secure) connections due to a project I was working on at work.  There was code
throughout the application making it impractical to just disable TLS and the fake SMTP servers
I tried either did not have the ability to use TLS or crashed thus Origami SMTP was born.

It started out and still is two separate projects. [Origami SMTP][1] was the console application
and library and Origami GUI (this project) was the graphical user interface for that library
in order to make it easier to use. I decided to call the combined work Origami SMTP.
